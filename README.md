# Efficient-Exponentiation
## Comparison of exponentiation process times using naive and binary methods.

Use very large exponents to demonstrate the efficiency difference.
although python can only handle the display of numbers to a certain level
after which zeros will be displayed.

For example, 2^2048 will calculate efficiently in 12 calculations, and simply
in 2047 calculations.

2^4096 will calculate efficiently in 13 calculations, and simply
in 4095 calculations.

2^8192 will calculate efficiently in 14 calculations, and simply
in 8191 calculations.
